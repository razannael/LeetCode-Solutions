        # Spoiler alert: *** is WRONG. If we've seen the state in DFS, it means that we don't
        # have an answer yet. NOT that it's necessarily a loop.

        # Example: suppose the state is (m, c, player) where
        #    m, c are the mouse and cat locations
        #    player is whose turn it is to play

        # Some states are easy, like (m, c, mouse) where m is adjacent to zero.

        # For DFS we automatically fill in the table (the code determines the recurrence rel.)
        # but we know that all the calls will terminate in a base case.
